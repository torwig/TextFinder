Description
The application searches for particular text on the start web-page(https only) and, if the text wasn't found, on all pages which can be reached from the start page.
If the text has been found the application will show 'the context' (n characters before and after).
You can set number of working threads and limit the number of web-pages.

Requirements.
Tested with Qt framework version 5.6 and higher.
